"Quantitative" outcome - or is it?

Predictor - NLR - continuous or categorical (by interval)?

Normal assumption untenable

- non-parametric method - Kruskal-Wallis
    - compare NLR levels against lowest (Dunn's test)
    
- ordered categorical variable - ordinal logistic regression
    - NLR categories
    - NLR continuous
